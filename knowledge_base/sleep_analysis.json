    "summary":"The AI-Driven Sleep Analysis & Optimization agent integrates sleep quality, respiration rate, and sleep duration to offer actionable insights and personalized routines for improved sleep efficiency. For users experiencing poor sleep quality (1-6 hours) combined with imbalanced respiration rates, the system recommends meditation practices such as Guided Sleep Meditation, Body Scan Meditation, and Deep Breathing techniques (Pranayama) to help calm the mind and improve overall respiratory function. Light pre-bedtime exercises like stretching and progressive muscle relaxation are suggested, while dietary recommendations include nutrient-rich fruits (such as apples, bananas, and berries) that support restful sleep. For individuals with normal or longer sleep durations, monitoring sleep patterns along with mindful breathing practices ensures sustained benefits and adjustments in lifestyle. This holistic approach, intertwining meditation, gentle exercise, and targeted nutrition, optimizes both sleep quality and overall well-being."
