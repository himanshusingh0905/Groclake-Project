    "summary":"The AI-Powered Nutrition & Hydration Tracker leverages calorie burn and body temperature data to provide personalized meal, exercise, and hydration recommendations. For better nutrition, detailed meal plans suggest balanced options: low energy scenarios focus on energizing breakfasts like oatmeal with almonds and light meals such as quinoa salads, while higher energy demands recommend protein-rich meals like grilled salmon or paneer stir-fry. Accompanying these meal plans are targeted exercise recommendations—ranging from brisk walks and bodyweight routines to strength training and yoga—that help optimize calorie burn and support overall health. Additionally, hydration reminders, tailored by activity and body temperature, ensure the body remains well-fueled and balanced throughout the day."
