    "summary":"The provided stress level data classifies stress into three categories—normal, moderate, and high—each with tailored recommendations to manage and alleviate stress. For normal stress levels, the focus is on maintaining a balanced lifestyle through regular sleep, light exercises, and mindfulness meditation such as Sukhasana with deep breathing. Moderate stress suggestions include adopting daily routines, engaging in gentle practices like Tai Chi and guided relaxation (e.g., Bhramari Pranayama), and incorporating calming activities such as gratitude journaling. High stress levels are addressed with more intensive interventions including HIIT, strength training, outdoor walks, and specialized meditation techniques like Yoga Nidra and Vipassana Meditation. These holistic strategies are supplemented by dietary advice that encourages the inclusion of nutrient-dense foods and herbal adaptogens to further support emotional and physical well-being."
